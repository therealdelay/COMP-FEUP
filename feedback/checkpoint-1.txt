CHECKPOINT 1 FEEDBACK
=====================
Class 3 - Group 33

These notes are based on an analysis of commit 38895996a5bc0b573118356557742c19880913a6.
If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- Name of file to compile should not be hardcoded.
	- In "function a=b()", parser incorrectly states that "a" is the name of the function, when "b" is the correct value ("a" is the output of the function).
	- Tree Annotation is incomplete:
		- Missing "-" operator in Term()
		- Missing <RELA_OP> value in Exprtest()
		- Missing initialization value in Declaration()

Low-priority:
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
	- Stop after the first 10 parser errors
	- Add comments to explain/document your code
	- Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
	- Consider rewriting the grammar to avoid use of LOOKAHEADs.
