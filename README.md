## SUMMARY

The tool is a compilar for the Yal Programming Language. 

By receiving a _.yal_ file, the tool parses the file, outputting any lexical, syntactic or semantic error. 

Afterwards, the tool generates the necessary code to compile it in the Jasmin Assembler, which outputs a _.class_ file.


## EXECUTE

To run the tool, simply run java -jar <name of the jar file.jar> <yal file to compile>. If you have any doubt, you can run it without arguments, which will indicate how to run the tool.

## DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERROS
 (Describe how the syntactic error recovery of your tool does work. Does it exit after the first error?)

## SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
 (Refer the semantic rules implemented by your tool.)


## INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs)
(for example, when applicable, briefly describe the HLIR (high-level IR) and the LLIR (low-level IR) used, if your tool includes an LLIR with structure different from the HLIR)


##CODE GENERATION: 
(when applicable, describe how the code generation of your tool works and identify the possible problems your tool has regarding code generation.)


##OVERVIEW: 
(refer the approach used in your tool, the main algorithms, the third-party tools and/or packages, etc.)


## TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: 
(Describe the content of your testsuite regarding the number of examples, the approach to automate the test, etc.)



## TASK DISTRIBUTION
(Identify the set of tasks done by each member of the project.)

## PROS
 (Identify the most positive aspects of your tool)
## CONS
 (Identify the most negative aspects of your tool)
