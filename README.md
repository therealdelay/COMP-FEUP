# YAL Compiler

## Checkpoint 2

All required tasks were completed. 

Our grammar also allows functions with the same name, but they are differentiated by the number or type of parameters.

Most of the feedback notes from Checkpoint 1 were implemented and fixed.

In addition, we developed a simple user interface to ease the running process. To run the parser we have a script named "script.sh" that starts the program. Then the interface asks for the file path, starting on the folder "yalExamples" from our repository. After this, the interface asks if it should print the AST and the Symbol Table for the given file.
